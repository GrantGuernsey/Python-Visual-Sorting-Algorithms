# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This Python script visualizes various sorting algorithms using Pygame. Users can observe the step-by-step sorting process for algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Counting Sort.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Visualizer
### Clone the Repository:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
### Navigate to the Directory:

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the sortingAlgorithms.py file.
### Run the Script:

Execute the script using the following command:
```
python sortingAlgorithms.py
```

## Visualization Controls
The visualization window will display the array of bars representing elements to be sorted.

The window title shows the current sorting algorithm in action.

Observe the step-by-step sorting process until completion.

Close the window to exit the program.

## Sorting Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Insertion Sort**
3. **Selection Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**
6. **Heap Sort**
7. **Counting Sort**

## Customization
The script generates a random array for sorting. You can customize the size and range of the array in the generate_random_array function.

## Notes
Adjust the FPS (frames per second) variable to control the speed of the visualization.
The visualization window will close automatically after the sorting process is complete.
Feel free to explore different sorting algorithms and visualize their behavior. Modify the script to suit your preferences or integrate additional sorting algorithms for further experimentation.
